# 🖼️ SVD Image Explorer: An Interactive Deep Dive into Image Compression

**SVD Image Explorer** is a high-performance Streamlit web application that **demonstrates image compression using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**. Users can upload images and instantly see the trade-offs between data compression and visual fidelity

---

## ✨ Core Features

- **Real-time SVD Computation:** Upload JPG, JPEG, or PNG images and compute SVD instantly.  
- **Interactive Rank Selection:** Slider to select the number of singular values (`k`) for reconstruction.  
- **Auto Rank Selection by Energy:** Set a target cumulative energy (e.g., 95%) and let the app automatically choose the smallest suitable `k`.  
- **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Original vs reconstructed image visualization.  
- **Least Important Ranks Visualization:** See discarded image details using the last singular values.  
- **Information Loss Heatmap:** Visualize absolute error between original and reconstructed images.  
- **Animated Reconstruction:** Gradually build the image from rank 1 to the selected rank for a dynamic understanding.  
- **Singular Value & Cumulative Energy Plots:** Visualize energy distribution across singular values for each channel.  
- **Quantitative Compression Report:** Metrics including SVD values stored, compression ratio, storage savings, and pixel counts.
- **Quality Benchmark Table:** Built-in preset ranks showing **PSNR**, compression factor, and storage savings for fast decision making.

## 🔬 Most vs. Least Important Details

This shows the power of SVD:

- **Most Important Ranks (Top k):** Capture the main structure and shapes of the image.  
- **Least Important Ranks (Last k):** Capture subtle textures, fine details, and noise.  
- Helps users understand which parts of the image contribute most to its perceptual quality.

## 🛠️ Technical Deep Dive & Optimizations

### Performance & Memory Management
- **Pre-computation Resizing:** Uploaded images are automatically resized to a maximum dimension of 1024px to reduce computation while preserving visual quality.  
- **Efficient SVD Computation:** Uses `numpy.linalg.svd(full_matrices=False)` for thin SVD, reducing memory usage and speeding up computations.  
- **Optimized Data Types:** Images are converted to `np.float32` before SVD for numerical stability and compatibility with linear algebra routines.  

### Caching Strategy (Future Enhancement)
- SVD computations can be cached using `@st.cache_data` to prevent repeated processing, improving performance for repeated runs or multiple users.  

```python
@st.cache_data
def perform_svd(channels):
    # ... SVD logic ...
```

### Modular & Scalable Architecture
- **app.py:** Handles UI layout and user interactions.  
- **src/image_processing.py:** Core numerical and image processing logic.  
- **src/plotting.py:** Visualization and plotting logic.  
- **src/utils.py:** Helper functions (byte formatting, image resizing, etc.).  

This modular structure ensures easy maintenance, scalability, and separation of concerns.

## ⚠️ Notes on SVD vs File Size

- **SVD Compression Report:** Shows **theoretical size** based on number of floating-point values required for SVD.  
- **PNG File Size:** May differ due to PNG's internal lossless compression.  
- High-rank reconstructions may sometimes result in PNG files larger than lower-rank reconstructions due to pattern efficiency.

---

## 📊 Learning Insights

- **Energy Preserved Metric:** Shows percentage of total image energy retained by top k singular values.  
- **PSNR Metric:** Quantifies reconstruction quality in decibels so users can compare objective quality across ranks.  
- **Difference Visualization:** Highlights areas where image information is lost.  
- **Animated Reconstruction:** Builds image rank-by-rank to demonstrate reconstruction visually.  
- **Cumulative Energy Plot:** Emphasizes that most image energy is concentrated in top singular values.  
- **Preset Quality Table:** Quickly compares rank choices for quality vs compression trade-off.
